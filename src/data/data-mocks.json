I’ve been there.\n\nI dropped out of High School after 10th grade, so I never learned any math beyond trigonometry in school. When I started my journey into Machine Learning, I didn’t even know what a derivative was.\n\nFast forward to today, and I’m an Applied Scientist at Amazon, and I feel pretty confident in my math skills.\n\nI’ve picked up the necessary math along the way using free resources and self-directed learning. Today I’m going to walk you through some of my favorite books, courses, and YouTube channels that helped me get to where I am today, and I’ll also share some tips on how to study effectively and not waste your time struggling and being bored."

But if you’re asking yourself if you need to learn math, chances are that’s not the kind of job you’re looking for…\n\nBut for practitioners — most of us in the industry — you can often be totally competent without knowing all the underlying details, especially as a beginner.\n\nAt this point, libraries like numpy, scikit-learn, and Tensorflow handle most of the heavy lifting for you. You don’t need to know the math behind gradient descent to deploy a model to production.\n\nIf you’re a beginner trying to get into ML, in my opinion it is not strategic to spend a bunch of time memorizing formulas or studying linear algebra — you should be spending that time building things. Train a simple model. Explore your data. Build a pipeline that predicts something fun.\n\nThat said, there are moments where knowing the math really helps. Here are a few examples:\n\nImagine you’re training a model and it’s not converging. If you understand concepts like gradients and optimization functions, you’ll know whether to adjust your learning rate, try a different optimizer, or tweak your data preprocessing."
